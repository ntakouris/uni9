XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a family of XML markup
languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely-used Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML), the language in which web pages are written. XHTML 1.0 became
a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000, for
encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
